# Can I float through Canoe Pass?

[canoepass.info](http://canoepass.info) predicts whether the water is currently high enough to float through [Canoe Pass](https://goo.gl/maps/GyC6zTdkdnPqanpM7)</a> (also known as Bargain Narrows) between [Pender Harbour](http://www.penderharbour.ca) and Bargain Harbour, on the Sunshine Coast](https://sunshinecoastcanada.com)</a> of British Columbia, Canada.

[Canoes and kayaks](http://www.penderharbour.ca/kayaking-paddleboarding-canoeing.html) can float through Canoe Pass when the tide at the pass is above about 10 feet; the rest of the time the pass is dry.
 
This site uses data from the [Canadian Hydrographic Service's tide API](https://api-iwls.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config) to predict the tide height at Canoe Pass.  The times are based on the predicted tides for [Irvine's Landing](https://tides.gc.ca/en/stations/7836) with a 30-minute delay added to compensate for the distance from Irvine's Landing to Canoe Pass.
